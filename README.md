# etch-a-sketch

This is the first version of the etch-a-sketc project from The Odin Project Foundation curriculum.

To improve:
- I would like to add additional features to the progressive mode, so that instead of having to reset the grid, the already selected color would apply from 0 to any differently colored tile.

Known issues:
- After setting the eraser, color change is necessary to begin painting again
- To start painting in Progressive mode, color has to be selected after entering the mode
- Eraser not working in Rainbow mode
